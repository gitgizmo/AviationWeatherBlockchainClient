The following are instructions on how to set up and configure the Aviation Weather Blockchain Client Multichain node, and
create a AviationWeatherBlockchainClient to query it.

Prerequisite
- A AviationWeatherBlockchainProcessor peer node must be set up and running
- Must have IP address and network port for the peer AviationWeatherBlockchainClient node
 

1. Install multichain 2.0 or later
https://www.multichain.com/download-install/

2. Synchronize chain

multichaind metar@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:yyyy

where:
- xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP address of the node from which you want synchronize, 
such as the AviationWeatherBlockchainProcessor.
- yyyy is the network port used for the metar blockchain. See default-network-port in the metar params.dat file on the
node for which you want to synchronize.

You may need to ask the administrator of that blockchain if you do not have access to that file.

If you are synchronzing to the public available AviationWeatherBlockchainProcessor metar block chain then you can connect as follows

multichaind metar@192.168.1.102:2653

The metar chain will immediately start to synchronize. Please see the following link to determine when the chain is finished synch'ing

If you have created your own AviationWeatherBlockchainProcessor, then you should use its IP and network port.

3. Subscribe to the streams

subscribeStream.sh

This may take several minutes depending on the amount of data synchronized since the subscribing to a stream
causes the blockchain to index the data for each stream.

Note: Confirm the files have the required execute permission. Be sure to review the output for any failures.

4. (Optional) Change rpc username and password
Although you are free to use the generated rpcuser and rpcpassword found in the metar multichain.conf file, its recommended
that you choose hard to guess ones. Simply edit the metar multichain.conf file on the sync'd node and change them. If the node 
is running then you need to stop it first, then restart it.

Note the usename and password will NOT be the same as the peer blockchain.

On Linux you can stop the metar chain as follows
multichain-cli metar stop

On Windows, press CLTR-C twice.

Start the metar chain as shown in step 2

5. Use AviationWeatherBlockchainClient to query the local copy of the replicated blockchain.

Using the RPC port (and not the network port), username and password you can create 
AviationWeatherBlockchainClient as follows. Note that the RPC port is found in the 
params.dat file in the metar directory in the default-rpc-port property.

		
		AviationWeatherBlockchainClient awbc = new AviationWeatherBlockchainClient("http://127.0.0.1:2652/", "foouser", "barpassword");
		
See SampleClient.java in the jar or code base for a fulsome example

6. You are done!

Common problems
- firewall not opened on the client blockchain
- firewall not opened on the serving blockchain
- using the network port instead of the RPC port in client code
- using rpc port when synch'ing
- using incorrect username and password
- subscribe not performed, partially performed or failed
- serving blockchain not running
